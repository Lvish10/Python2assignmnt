# Python2assignmnt

Welcome to **Python2assignmnt** — a creative and practical collection of Python projects, crafted as part of an academic assignment to demonstrate versatile development skills in both web and desktop application domains. This repository is designed not only to fulfill curriculum requirements, but also to serve as a showcase of best practices and hands-on exploration with Python’s most powerful frameworks.

## 📚 About This Repository

This repository features two major project tracks:

- **`django/`**  
  Dive into server-side web development with Django, showcasing a School Management System for tracking student marks and experimenting with both SQL and CSV data storage. These projects illustrate real-world scenarios of authentication, data management, admin dashboards, and more — all built using Django’s robust ecosystem.

- **`tkinter/`**  
  Experience the world of desktop GUI development with Python’s Tkinter library. These applications prioritize user interaction and intuitive design, making them perfect for demonstrating event-driven programming and cross-platform interfaces.

- **`requirements.txt`**  
  A ready-to-use list of dependencies required for running and experimenting with the Django applications (and possibly other scripts) in this repository.
